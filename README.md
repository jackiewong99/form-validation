# form-validation

In this project, I am demonstrating and practicing validation of form data using [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) (RegEx) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (for authentication and email verification).

As my experience grows, I plan to improve the user experience of this project in the future. However, as of now my goal for this project was to get experience with validating form data.
