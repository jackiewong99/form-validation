    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      In this project, I am demonstrating and practicing validation of form data
      using Regular Expressions (RegEx) and Firebase (for authentication and
      email verification).
    </p>
    <p>
      I could definitely improve the user experience, however my main focus for
      this project was to practice validating form data and get the project out.
